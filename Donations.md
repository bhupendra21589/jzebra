jZebra has been in development since 2008 and exists solely because of the rich community of developers that show support for the project.

Since the project's birth, there's been over 3,000 emails and over 300 public conversation threads from the mailing list and project page alone.  That does not include questions on stackoverflow, javaranch (100s of others).  The project lives on google code, but binary releases are mirrored on softpedia, freecode and dozens of other sites.

As more and more businesses have a need for browser-based printing -- especially in the shipping and POS/retail industry -- a need for thermal printing, direct image printing, card printing via web page is demanded more each day.  jZebra offers this for free!

Most feature requests should go through the [bug tracker](http://code.google.com/p/jzebra/issues/list).  Additionally, if you have a specific feature request for jZebra that needs to be expedited (e.g. 2-week or 1-month turn-around), I'll happily quote a price and usually respond the same day.  I can have an estimate prepared with a few days.  I am willing to work on a per-job or per-hour basis.  I will honor contracts as well (so as long as they don't violate the project's goals or the GPL3 license).

Donations are not mandatory, and you or your company can donate without spending money by offering code or help through the wiki or mailing list.

If you or your company finds jZebra beneficial (or profitable) please consider contributing back to the project.  jZebra was not created to make money. Most helpful are contributions on the mailing list and wiki.  Development costs for jZebra are minimal thanks to services such as NetBeans and Google Code, however answering support questions takes a considerable amount of my time.

Money is also gracefully accepted!  Proceeds go to maintaining modern Windows, Linux, OS X workstations to test on and to occasionally take my family out to dinner (or fix my [1991 vw](http://i.imgur.com/m24hL.jpg)!)

All code changes/features added jZebra will comply with GPL3 license and be made publicly available in source (and binary) to the general public.  Documentation on the wiki will generally lag behind 1 month.

All donations, requests or even just a "hello" or "thanks", please email me:  tres.finocchiaro@gmail.com.  I'm happy to hear that jZebra helped you, and I enjoy having a strong network of developers to turn to.
